Goal: Make Planet the new homepage and extend to the other flows. Do NOT delete/rename any current code, routes, or UI. Additive, feature-flagged rollout.

Guardrails
Add-only / backward-compatible. No removals or renames.

Gate with HACKSPHERE_PLANET_HOME_ENABLED=true.

Flag off ➜ keep today’s homepage and behavior.

Flag on ➜ "/" shows Planet Home; all old pages still reachable.

1) Planet = Homepage (Participants + Mentors)
Create page: src/planets/HomePlanet.tsx and route /planet (used as / when flag on).

Galaxy Map background (SVG/Canvas) with country-like boundaries per team using a Voronoi tessellation (e.g., d3-voronoi):

Each team = country polygon with a clear border (2–3px) and soft shadow.

Size scales with awards/medals (land area ∝ award points; clamp min/max).

Hover shows LandCard (title, tagline, demo, badges, chips).

Click on MY country ➜ Team Management (link to the existing management page; don’t replace it).

Explore: clicking other countries opens their LandCard (no edit controls).

Styling: use bright palette; borders high-contrast; keep fun/clean.

2) Investor/Sponsor Planet (Search-on-Map)
Page: src/planets/InvestorsPlanet.tsx → route /planets/investors.

Background: map of investor “lands” (same country style + size by their chips/awards).

Google-style search bar centered on the map (large, pill radius) with keyword + filters.

Results highlight matching teams on the same map + side list.

Show competitors (other investors matching similar interests) as labeled countries so investors can see peers on the map.

Cards include Allocate Chips and AI Match button.

Do not alter existing investor APIs; add new ones under /api/v1/planets/* if needed.

3) Judges + Organizers Planet
Page: src/planets/JudgesOrganizersPlanet.tsx → route /planets/judges.

Same country metaphor (size by awards/points).

Quick actions: Create Event, Announcements, Go to Judging Queue (link to existing features).

Scoreboard overlay shows medals/points; no change to current judging flow.

4) Country Boundaries (clear visuals)
Use Voronoi + smoothing for organic shapes.

Stroke: 2–3px, brand Primary Blue for my team, neutral for others; subtle drop shadow for depth.

Hover/selected country has glow; keyboard focus visible.

5) UI Cleanups (your comments)
Settings page

Increase border contrast (border color darker by ~20%).

Fix layout: consistent card widths, proper spacing; ensure responsive at 360–1440px.

Community → Discussion channels

Next to the green “234”, prepend label: Total 234 (or Tổng 234).

Navigation reorg (clearer)

Top-level order: Home (Planet), Teams, Schedule, Submissions, Judging, Mentors, Investors, Community, Profile, Settings.

Keep all existing links; this is a reorder only when the flag is on.

Add a divider before Settings to reduce clutter.

6) Data/Logic (additive)
If needed, add read-only endpoints for map data under /api/v1/planets:

GET /map/teams → team id, awards score, centroid, track, myTeam flag.

GET /map/investors → investor id, interests, chips score, competitor tags.

No changes to existing tables. New tables must be separate and optional.

7) Acceptance Criteria
With flag off: site looks/works exactly as today.

With flag on:

/ = Planet Home with country boundaries; clicking my country opens existing Team Management.

Investors planet shows big search bar on map, highlights matching teams + competitor investors.

Land sizes reflect award counts across all planets.

Settings border is darker; community channel shows “Total 234”; nav is simpler.

No regressions or deleted functionality.

Ask before changing any existing component outside /planets/*.
