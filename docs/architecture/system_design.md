# HackSphere AI System Architecture Design

As a system architect, I'll provide a comprehensive system architecture design for the HackSphere AI platform based on the project requirements and modern architectural best practices.

## High-Level Architecture Overview

The HackSphere AI platform follows a **cloud-native microservices architecture** with **event-driven patterns** and **AI agent orchestration** to deliver scalable, resilient, and autonomous hackathon management capabilities.

### Core Architectural Principles

**Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Services are organized around business domains (Team Management, Judging, Mentoring, etc.) with clear bounded contexts.[1][2]

**Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous communication between services using events to maintain loose coupling and enable scalability.[3][4][5]

**API-First Design**: All services expose well-defined APIs following RESTful principles with OpenAPI specifications.[6][7]

**Security by Design**: Zero-trust security model with authentication, authorization, and encryption at every layer.[8][9][10]

**Observability First**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing across all services for operational excellence.[11][12][13]

## Detailed System Architecture

### 1. Presentation Layer

- Recovery point objective (RPO): 15 minutes

**Incident Response**
- Automated alerting and escalation procedures
- Runbooks for common scenarios
- Post-incident reviews and improvements
- Chaos engineering for resilience testing

## Implementation Blueprint (MVP-first to Enterprise)

### Delivery Strategy

- Start with a modular monolith for core domains plus two auxiliary processes:
  - Core API service (TypeScript/NestJS or Python/FastAPI)
  - AI Orchestrator service (Python)
  - Notifications/Workers (Node.js or Python) consuming a job queue
- Adopt the outbox pattern for reliable event emission. Use Redis Streams/BullMQ for MVP; introduce Kafka/NATS in Phase 2 as scale/ordering/retention requirements grow.
- Maintain API-first contracts with OpenAPI and generate typed SDKs for the frontend.

### Technology Choices (Recommended)

- Frontend: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind, shared `packages/ui`
- Core API: NestJS (Fastify adapter), Zod/DTO validation, Drizzle with PostgreSQL
- AI Orchestrator: Python 3.11+, LangChain/CrewAI, OpenAI or OSS LLMs; `pgvector` for embeddings
- Data: PostgreSQL (managed), Redis (cache/queues), S3-compatible storage for artefacts
- Observability: OpenTelemetry SDK, Tempo/Jaeger, Prometheus + Grafana, Sentry for FE/BE
- Auth: Managed OIDC (Auth0/Clerk/Supabase Auth), JWT access tokens, role claims

## Tenancy Model and Data Partitioning

- Single database, shared schema with `organization_id` on all tenant data for MVP.
- Enforce row-level filters in the data access layer. Optionally enable PostgreSQL RLS in Phase 2.
- Soft deletes with `deleted_at` for auditability and recovery.

## Bounded Contexts and Core Data Model

### Contexts

- Identity & Access: organizations, users, roles, memberships, audit logs
- Events & Schedule: events, tracks, sessions, speakers
- Teams: teams, team_members, skills, tags
- Mentorship: mentor_profiles, availability_slots, bookings, feedback
- Submissions: projects, artefacts, repo_links, reviews, ai_pre_reviews
- Judging: rubrics, criteria, assignments, scores, comments, conflicts
- Community: channels, messages, notifications, reactions
- Sponsors: organizations_ext, contacts, campaigns, touchpoints
- Knowledge/Archive: documents, embeddings, indexes

### Representative Tables (PostgreSQL)

## Event and Job Catalog

- Domain Events
  - `user.added_to_org`, `event.created`, `team.created`, `submission.submitted`, `judging.score.recorded`, `mentor.booking.created`, `notification.sent`

- Integration Events
  - `slack.message.received`, `calendar.booking.created`, `github.push.received`, `apify.prospect.found`

- Jobs
  - `submission.pre_review.generate`, `mentor.match.recommend`, `sponsor.deck.generate`, `community.digest.send`, `analytics.snapshot.compute`

Outbox dispatcher publishes to Redis Stream topics in MVP; migrate to Kafka with DLQs and retention policies in Phase 2.

## RBAC and Permissions Matrix

| Action/Resource | Participant | Mentor | Judge | Sponsor | Admin |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| View event/schedule | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Create/join team | ✓ |  |  |  | ✓ |
| Book mentor | ✓ |  |  |  | ✓ |
| Manage mentor slots |  | ✓ |  |  | ✓ |
| Submit project | ✓ |  |  |  | ✓ |
| Score submissions |  |  | ✓ |  | ✓ |
| View aggregated scores |  |  | ✓ |  | ✓ |
| Access sponsor analytics |  |  |  | ✓ | ✓ |
| Manage users/roles |  |  |  |  | ✓ |

Enforce at the API layer using role claims from OIDC and organization membership checks. Add ABAC policies (e.g., Oso) in Phase 2 if needed.

## Observability, SLOs, and Alerting

- SLOs (MVP targets)
  - Core API: p95 latency < 300 ms; 99.9% uptime monthly
  - Job processing: 95% jobs < 60s end-to-end
  - AI pre-review: p95 completion < 25s
- Telemetry
  - OpenTelemetry traces span FE → API → DB/Queue → Workers
  - RED metrics per service (Rate, Errors, Duration)
- Alerting
  - Error rate > 2% for 5m
  - Queue lag > 5 minutes
  - DB CPU > 80% for 10m; connections > 80% pool size

## Security Controls (MVP)

- OIDC authentication with short-lived JWTs and refresh tokens
- RBAC with least privilege, server-side checks, audit logs for sensitive actions
- Secrets in cloud secret manager; KMS-encrypted at rest; TLS 1.2+ in transit
- COI in judging: explicit declarations and enforcement on assignments
- PII minimization; data retention policies (see below)

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests: domain logic, validation, mappers
- Contract tests: OpenAPI schema, generated SDK compatibility
- Integration tests: API ↔ DB/Redis/S3 (dockerized)
- E2E tests: core flows (team formation, mentor booking, submission, judging)
- Load tests: k6/Gatling for critical endpoints and queues
- Chaos tests: pod restarts, DB failover drills in staging

## CI/CD and Environments

- GitHub Actions pipelines:
  - PR: lint, typecheck, unit + integration, build, preview deploy
  - Main: build images, run migrations, deploy to staging with smoke tests, then prod with canary
- Environments: dev (Docker Compose), staging (managed DB/Redis, single region), prod (HA, backups, WAF/CDN)

## Data Retention and Privacy

- Logs: 30 days (MVP), extend via cold storage for enterprise
- AI artefacts and embeddings: 180 days; purge on org request
- User data export and deletion endpoints per org (GDPR-friendly)

## Capacity and Cost Guardrails (MVP)

- Postgres: 2–4 vCPU, 8–16 GB RAM; 50–100 GB storage; pgbouncer pooler
- Redis: single-node cache/queue, 1–2 GB RAM
- API: 2 replicas min; HPA 2–8; workers: autoscale by queue depth
- LLM usage: rate limits per org; caching of AI results by content hash

## Failure Scenarios and Runbooks (Outline)

- Queue backlog: scale workers; enable DLQ; replay with idempotency keys
- LLM outages: degrade to cached summaries; user-visible banners
- Calendar/Slack API rate limits: exponential backoff and retry policies
- DB migration failure: feature flag rollbacks, migration guardrails (preflight)

## Workflow Blueprints (Selected)

### Submission Pre-Review

1) User submits → API stores submission, writes outbox `submission.submitted`
2) Worker consumes event → fetches artefacts → runs AI chain → stores `ai_pre_reviews` → emits `submission.pre_review.ready`
3) Notification worker sends message to team/judges

### Mentor Booking

1) Team requests slot → API checks conflicts and capacity → reserves slot (transaction) → writes outbox `mentor.booking.created`
2) Worker triggers Calendar invite and Slack DM → updates booking status

## Service Extraction Plan (Phase 2+)

- Extract Notifications → dedicated service when QPS > threshold or channels multiply
- Extract Judging → when rubric complexity and load require independent scaling
- Extract Mentorship → when calendar throughput or integrations increase
- Introduce Kafka → replace Redis Streams for durable, ordered, cross-service events
- Introduce Temporal/Zeebe → orchestrate long-running sponsor outreach and multi-step workflows

## Open Questions

- Preferred auth provider? (Auth0/Clerk/Supabase Auth) -> Supabase Auth
- Primary backend language for Core API? (TypeScript vs Python) -> TypeScript
- REST-only for v1, or add GraphQL/BFF for composition? -> REST-only
- Must-have enterprise integrations (CRM/email provider) for MVP? -> No

This comprehensive system architecture, paired with the MVP-first implementation blueprint above, provides HackSphere AI with the foundation to scale to 100,000+ users while maintaining high performance, security, and reliability. The modular design enables rapid feature development and deployment while the AI agent orchestration delivers the autonomous capabilities required for the platform's vision.
