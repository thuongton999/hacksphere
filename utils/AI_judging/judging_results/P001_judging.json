  "summary": "EcoSmart Waste Management System leverages IoT sensors, computer vision, and machine learning to optimize waste collection in urban areas by dynamically adjusting routes and schedules based on real-time fill levels and waste composition. This data-driven approach significantly reduces operational costs, environmental impact, and improves citizen engagement through a reward-based mobile app.",
  "feedback": {
    "strengths": [
      "The integration of ultrasonic sensors and CNN-based computer vision for real-time waste classification achieves 92% accuracy, demonstrating strong technical sophistication and innovation in automated waste sorting.",
      "The use of machine learning to predict waste generation patterns and optimize collection routes results in a 28% reduction in travel distance, showcasing measurable efficiency gains backed by pilot data.",
      "The inclusion of a citizen-facing React Native app with gamified rewards for proper sorting enhances public participation and supports behavioral change, increasing the system's social impact.",
      "Pilot results show a 30% reduction in collection trips and 40% fewer overflowing bins, providing concrete evidence of operational effectiveness and scalability potential.",
      "The project addresses a $2.1 billion global market with clear applications across cities, campuses, and industrial zones, indicating strong commercial viability and broad relevance."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The text lacks details on data privacy, cybersecurity, and camera deployment ethics (e.g., surveillance concerns), which are critical for public trust and regulatory compliance in smart city deployments.",
      "No information is provided on the energy source or sustainability of the IoT sensors and cameras, raising concerns about long-term operational sustainability and environmental footprint.",
      "The mobile app's reward system is mentioned but not explainedâ€”how rewards are issued, tracked, or redeemed remains unclear, weakening the credibility of the engagement model.",
      "While the CNN model achieved 92% accuracy, there is no mention of model robustness across diverse waste types, lighting conditions, or bin configurations, which could limit real-world reliability.",
      "The presentation structure is fragmented, with incomplete sentences and abrupt truncation (e.g., 'reduce carbon emissions by optimizing collection routes and improve citizen satisfaction through better service quality'), reducing clarity and professionalism."
