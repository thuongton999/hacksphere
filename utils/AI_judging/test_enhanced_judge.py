    EcoSmart Waste Management System
    
    Problem Statement:
    Traditional waste management systems are inefficient and environmentally harmful. 
    Current methods result in 40% of recyclable materials being sent to landfills, 
    contributing to environmental pollution and resource waste.
    
    Methodology:
    Our solution uses IoT sensors and machine learning algorithms to optimize waste collection routes. 
    We implemented a Python-based backend with TensorFlow for route optimization and a React frontend 
    for real-time monitoring. The system processes data from 500+ sensors deployed across the city.
    
    Results:
    Initial testing shows 35% reduction in collection costs and 60% improvement in recycling rates. 
    The ML model achieved 87% accuracy in predicting optimal collection times. 
    Carbon emissions reduced by 25% through optimized routing.
    
    Conclusion:
    The EcoSmart system demonstrates significant potential for scalable waste management solutions. 
    Future work includes expanding to 10 additional cities and integrating blockchain for transparent 
    waste tracking. We plan to deploy the system using Docker containers on AWS infrastructure.
